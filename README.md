# MSP430 Tic Tac Toe Gamepad

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** using the **MSP430G2553 microcontroller**. Each player has a **custom game controller**, featuring:
- **An OLED display** to show the game board.
- **Buttons** for navigation and placing moves.
- **A buzzer** for audio feedback.
- **An LED** to indicate the active player‚Äôs turn.
- **UART communication** between two controllers via a **3-foot communication cable**.

The project reinforces concepts in **embedded system design, real-time communication, and user interaction**.

# üíæ Software Design
### Software Architecture
- **Main Function**: Manages game state and turns.
- **Initialize Processor**: Sets up WDT, timers, and clock.
- **Initialize Ports**: Configures GPIOs for **buttons, LEDs, buzzer, and I2C**.
- **Timer ISR**: Handles **button debouncing** and **buzzer timing**.
- **Button ISR**: Processes **navigation and selection inputs**.
- **LCD Function**: Updates the game board display.
- **Communication Function**: Synchronizes game state via **UART**.
- **Speaker Function**: Plays **sounds for navigation, move selection, and game results**.

### Pseudo Code
```c
// Initialization
Initialize processor, timers, and I2C
Initialize buttons, LEDs, and buzzer
Display empty grid on OLED

// Main Game Loop
WHILE true DO
    IF navigation button pressed THEN
        Move cursor & update OLED
        Play navigation sound
    ENDIF

    IF selection button pressed THEN
        Validate move
        IF valid THEN
            Place X or O
            Update OLED & check win/draw
            Play selection sound
            Switch turn & update LED
            Send game state via UART
        ELSE
            Display "Invalid Move"
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

    IF reset button pressed THEN
        Reset game state
        Clear OLED and LEDs
        Send reset signal via UART
    ENDIF

    IF game state received via UART THEN
        Update local board
        Display updated game state
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE
```
